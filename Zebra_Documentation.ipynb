        "* Most of our processing funtion access the watch_data and keyboard_data dictionaries which are shared. \n",

        "* We cannot have threads modifying the watch_data and keyboard_data dictionary/lists because the order matters\n",
        "\n",
        "With that in mind, we decided only to parallelize everything after `setup_predict` because the function only accesses the shared variable `authenticate` once, at the very end, and the order doesn't really matter. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Implementation\n",
        "\n",
        "The lock is a global variable that is created when the flask app is run for the first time: `lock = threading.Lock()`. \n",
